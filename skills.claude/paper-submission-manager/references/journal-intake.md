# Journal Intake

Use these questions to gather what is needed to plan a submission.

## Target Details
- Target journal name and article type?
- Is there an existing dated submission folder to use?
- Which manuscript file is the current source of truth (`.docx` vs `.md`)?

## Requirements
- Are author instructions available in the target folder?
- Any required forms or questionnaires already present?
- Figure format and resolution requirements?

## Packaging
- Preferred naming for the new bundle (e.g., `YYYYMMDD_Journal`)?
- Any previous submission versions to carry forward?
